Establishing a standardized set of rules or grammar for emojis should provoke a lot of thought and discussion. Let's outline a basic framework that might serve as a starting point:

1. **Emoji Placement:**
   - *Sentence-End Emojis:* Emojis used at the end of sentences can function similarly to punctuation, adding emotional context to the statement. For instance, "I had a great day 😀" uses the emoji to convey happiness about the statement. When used in this way the sentence would not requirea period. The emoji serves that purpose.
   - *In-Line Emojis:* When used within a sentence, akin to an adverb or adjective, the emoji should directly follow the word or phrase it's describing to prevent confusion. E.g., "The cat 🐱 was very playful today."

2. **Emoji Repetition:**
   - Emojis should not be overly repeated without adding new meaning or emphasis to prevent visual clutter. For example, "I'm so happy 😃😃😃" could be acceptable to emphasize extreme happiness, but excessive repetition beyond this might dilute the message's clarity.

3. **Contextual Appropriateness:**
   - Emojis used should be appropriate to the tone and context of the conversation. More subdued emojis might be more suitable for serious topics, while more expressive ones could be used for casual or exciting news.

4. **Cultural Sensitivity:**
   - Be mindful of emojis that may have different meanings in different cultures to avoid miscommunication. An emoji's interpretation can vary significantly internationally, so awareness of these nuances is crucial in multicultural communication.

5. **Emoji Consistency:**
   - When conveying a specific thought, feeling, or reaction, consistency in emoji use can help maintain clarity. Mixing emojis that convey conflicting emotions or ideas might confuse the reader about the intended message.

6. **Subject-Verb Agreement:**
   - When emojis are used to replace nouns or verbs in more complex sentence structures, ensure that the rest of the sentence maintains proper grammatical structure. For example, "👩‍🍳 is cooking 🍲" maintains the subject-verb agreement, with emojis as nouns.

7. **Emoji Definitions:**
   - While emojis can be open to interpretation, using them in line with commonly understood definitions or sentiments can aid clarity. For example, a heart ❤️ is widely recognized as representing love or affection.

8. **Formality Consideration:**
   - Consider the formality of the communication. In professional or formal contexts, the use of emojis should be minimal and highly selective, whereas, in personal or informal communication, a wider range of emojis may be appropriate.

Please note these rules are hypothetical and primarily for the sake of discussion. The actual implementation of an emoji grammar would require extensive research, consideration of cultural nuances, and likely evolve naturally over time as did language grammar rules. But it's intriguing to consider how such rules might look! 💭📝🙂
